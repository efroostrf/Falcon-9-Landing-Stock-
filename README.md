# Falcon 9 Landing (Stock)- Cargo Module
This is a repository with a Falcon 9 craft on board with a crew module. A kOS script is also included. It is very simple and easy, even rude. For each rocket stages you need to load script. To do this, select the appropriate rocket stage in the kOS menu, and load the desired script. I recommend that you run the script initially for stage 2, and then 1. During the flight, do not accelerate time greater than x2. Since the landing may not materialize. It is important at the time of landing to control 1 stage of the rocket. The second stage of rocket will have time to gain the necessary height for the speedy re-launch of the script.

### Personal Changes
If you create new your load on the rocket, you may have problems landing 1 rocket stage. Since the code is very crude in numbers, you will test the change more than 1 time. <code> "Optional" </code> will tell you where to replace the values. Height is calculated from sea level, not surface.

#### Rocket Stage kOS Script
For 1 stage of rocket, use <code> 1St_Falcon9<sup>.ks</sup> </code>, 2 - <code> 2St_Falcon9<sup>.ks</sup> </code>.
